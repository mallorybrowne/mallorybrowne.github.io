                            <h2>Cozy Fall Potluck Shareables</h2>
                    
                                <p>How important is your potluck dish? Don't underestimate the draw of your go-to casserole. It was a recent interview question for a friend (not in the food industry) when one of her potential coworkers asked, "What's your potluck dish?" My friend coyly replied, "You'll have to hire me and find out." If someone in the office regularly brought black bean and quinoa salad, my buddy might still be perusing the want ads. (No word yet on the first office potluck or how her dish was received. It might come up on her first performance review.) This got me thinking about the potluck in all its incarnations, from the church basement to the next-door neighbor's backyard. How did the bring-a-dish-to-share tradition begin? And why is it called a potluck? It's hard to trace the potluck back to a specific source, but it's fair to say the term was used in the Middle Ages to describe an impromptu meal served to unexpected guests or travelers. Such a drop-in at the dinner hour would get "the luck of the pot:" whatever food was left over or kept on the simmer. Sometimes a potluck referred to a one-pot communal meal in which every cook brought something to add, rather like a "stone soup."</p>
                                <p>It wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th century in America that the idea of a meal where everyone brings a prepared dish to share took hold. The potluck has several features to recommend it. It's easy. Cost and time are shared among all the participants. Cooks can play to their strengths. Some potlucks are true free-for-alls and you never know if there will be six kinds of potato salad and no desserts, while others have a theme or guests are assigned a category, such as a dessert or appetizer. But no one likes a bossy organizer who assigns specific dishes or, even worse, hands out a specific recipe to follow.</p>

                                <p>Warm liquid is the one identifying factor of soup, so it's really no surprise people turn to soup in the colder months to feel a sense of comfort. Not only can the hot base be soothing to the throat and sinuses when sick, but a lot of the ingredients typically used in soup have immune-boosting effects, according to Toby Amidor, a registered dietician and author of The Family Immunity Cookbook. “Many soup stocks are made from bones of chicken, beef, or fish which are cooked for a few hours. This gives enough time for minerals like zinc, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium to transfer into the liquid stock,” she said. “Add in veggies and you’ve got even more nutrients in the soup.” The ease of cooking soup, whether microwaving it from a can or starting from scratch and throwing your ingredients into a slow cooker, makes it an easy lunch or dinner to whip up, no matter your lifestyle. Just set it and forget it! You can even get boxes delivered to your doorstep in bulk if you'd prefer someone else do the work.</p>

                                <p>Food is more than survival. With it, we make friends, court lovers, and count our blessings. The sharing of food has always been part of the human story. Children make mud pies, have tea parties, trade snacks to make friends, and mimic the rituals of adults. They celebrate with sweets from the time of their first birthday, and the association of food with love will continue throughout life—and in some belief systems, into the afterlife. Make sure to bring this tradition to your family and friends this holiday season to spread the dips and cheer.</p>

                                <p>
                                    If you've avoided cooking dry beans from scratch because "it takes too long," consider the actual "hands-on" time can be just minutes! All it takes is a little planning ahead for a time to soak the beans and a time to cook them.
